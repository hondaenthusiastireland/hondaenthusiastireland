            <h3>Transmission Calibration Service</h3>
            <p>
                Honda vehicles with automatic transmission require proper maintenance and calibration, especially Japanese hybrids such as Fit, Vezel, Shuttle, and so on that are rarely serviced by Irish dealerships.
                The detailed procedure is described below.

            <h3>Honda Software Updates Service</h3>
            <p>
                Vehicles imported from Japan may retain their original equipment manufacturer (OEM) settings (software), including crucial modules like the engine ECU and transmission computing unit. 
                It is important to note that due to past recall campaigns in Japan, these vehicles might not have received the necessary manufacturer updates. 
                This could potentially impact performance and lead to issues. Consider upgrading to ensure your vehicle runs smoothly and avoids potential damage.
                The detailed procedure is described below.

            <h3>Spare Key Writing Service</h3>
            <p>
                Many Japanese imports come to Ireland with only one key.
                At first, it could feel unnecessary to trouble ourselves with a spare one. 
                However, what if the only key gets lost or damaged somehow? 
                In this case, it could be extremely difficult to recover access to the car since the only means to interact with the immobilizer is via the original key.
                So, all in all, it surely feels safer to have a spare key.</p>

        <h2>More About Our Services</h2>
        <p>
            Honda Transmission Calibration Description:
            It is recommended to calibrate your transmission at least once a year, especially if your Honda has a dual-clutch transmission DCT (Honda Fit Hybrid, Vesel, etc.). 
            It’s even better to combine it with an annual clutch fluid DOT4 change. 
            The procedure allows your transmission to understand the clutch disk wear and adjust accordingly, which results in adequate shifting and performance overall, thereby making your car transmission last longer.
            The procedure lasts about 30-40 minutes, and it also requires some relatively empty and straight piece of road about 50 – 100m long for shift learning..
